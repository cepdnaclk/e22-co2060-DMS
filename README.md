### **Project Introduction**
___
The Debate Tournament Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the organization, management, and evaluation of debate tournaments. Traditional debate tournaments often rely on manual processes for scheduling, judging, scoring, and result compilation, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized, role-based digital platform.

The system supports multiple user roles including Admin, Organizer, Judge, and Participant, each with dedicated functionalities. Organizers can create and manage tournaments, rounds, and matches; judges can submit ballots and scores; and participants can view fixtures, results, and leaderboards. The application automatically processes scores and generates results, ensuring accuracy and transparency.

This project is developed as part of the CO2060 – Second Year Software Engineering Project and follows standard software engineering practices, including requirements specification, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
